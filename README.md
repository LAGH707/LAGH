# LAGH
Bodily interaction gameplay usually values players to enjoy their own experience but rarely lets people share emotional and physiological perspectives. To address this, we propose a collaboration game, LAGH, which adopts asymmetrical gameplay and uses the shared object schemes to support a positive cycle of social interaction. LAGH has extended the notion of perspective-taking into bodily play domain and provided two players to play from the first and second person perspectives in virtual reality, respectively. We conducted two user studies to investigate the social interaction between different person perspectives: the first comparing balance control play to oblique control play as well as the second comparing the effect of increasing degrees of interference control. Empirical results not only indicated that balance control play would enhance players' perceptions of social interplay value, connectedness, stimulated psychological level, and individual experience but also showed how to further improve the effects via interference control designs, such as changes in play timing and weather factors.
